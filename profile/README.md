The Amalfi Coast is a perfect blend of history, stunning views, and Mediterranean charm.

Whether you're a first-timer or a returning visitor, this guide will help you explore the best towns, activities, and the essence of what makes the Amalfi Coast so special.

## Amalfi Coast: The True Story

The Amalfi Coast, or Costiera Amalfitana, is a rare blend of nature’s enchantments, from deep blue waters shaded by forests to peaceful beaches nestled between charming towns like Positano, Amalfi, Ravello, and Sorrento. Its stunning cliffs, lush hills, and sunny shores have long attracted both film stars and travelers, offering some of the most romantic and picturesque landscapes in the Mediterranean.

Any prospective visitor must consider the different villages and what they can do. The very nature of viewing the Amalfi coastline offers a romantic potential: city drives, visit-and-return boat rides, or a simple stroll through narrow lanes of these historic towns.

## Best Communities along the Amalfi Coast

### 1) Positano: The Big Jewel on the Amalfi Coast

One of the most famous towns, considered by a few as the most iconic on the Amalfi Coast, Positano stands high on steep cliffs with houses of every color seemingly tumbling away to the sea, the most widely photographed of the Italian towns. It is known for narrow crooked streets, sprawling boutiques, and sublime views of that part of the Mediterranean.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Spiaggia Grande:** Positano's largest beach where a rainbow of umbrella colors blends with bright blue waters.
- **Shopping:** Handmade sandals, ceramics, and clothes.
- **Eating:** Fresh seafood meant to celebrate Mediterranean flavor.

One day from Positano: contemplate coastal charms, bathed in Californian sun, and sunset gaze with front-row view, perhaps with a little shopping in Italian haute couture along the way. Otherwise, a wonderful coastal getaway is on offer if a ferry shows up for a short sail from Sorrento or Amalfi.

### 2. Amalfi: The Ancient Heart of the Coast

It is an ancient seaport republic supposedly blessed with art and culture. The contemporary charm of the city remains legible tracing back to what Palazzo and other sights bestowed from that once illustrious past.

#### Key Sightings:
- **Amalfi Cathedral (Cattedrale di Sant'Andrea):** About the ninth century, the Cathedral shows fabulous mosaics and castings of Arab-Norman and Byzantine style never so well united to a campanile of like style.
- **Piazza del Duomo:** The main square of Amalfi, drink in the atmosphere while sipping your coffee in one of the open-air cafés.
- **Paper Museum:** Paper making was considered an ancient craft in the land of Amalfi. The museum gives the townspeople a glimmer, albeit slight, into a far-gone era.

If a little humor mixed with historical architecture and an ancient street full of stories charm the soul, Amalfi becomes an apt option for dream number one.

### 3. Ravello: The Garden City and City of Views

Below the hills in a very quiet little hamlet lie mature gardens blessed with views which painters claim and musicians return cash for.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Villa Rufolo:** Grand gardens and terrace settings overlooking the coast.
- **Villa Cimbrone:** An elegant villa and gardens with terraces descending to the famous "Terrace of Infinity": sweeping sea views.
- **Ravello Festival:** Summer performance festival for some of the world-famous musicians.

Under its calm and beautiful scenery flow artists' joy and sorrow from Ravello.

### 4. Sorrento: The Gateway to Amalfi

Because of the geographical peculiarity Soprillo, being outside of the Amalfi loop, is an excellent place to start one's Amalfi trek. From this peninsula, Sorrento enjoys a full view of the Bay of Naples, from where both the Amalfi and Isle of Capri are very, very easily accessible.

- **Piazza Tasso:** The main ring in Sorrento is the place people flock to for pastry and coffee.
- **Marina Grande:** It is the most photographed fishing port ever, with boats splashed with paint, juxtaposed against the genuine seafood restaurants.
- **Limoncello:** Being the Limburg coast known for its lemon groves, freshly made-grade limoncello stands on bartenders' counters in any of the town bars.
